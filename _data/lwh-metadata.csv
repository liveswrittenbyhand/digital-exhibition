lwh_100,,Travel Across Mediums: A Selection of Eighteenth-Century Travel Diaries,Ariannie Autie,2024,"In the 18th century travel and accounts of travel were considered learning opportunities, especially for younger upper-class men. During these travels, it was common practice for young men to create travel diaries. The writers of these accounts would typically include details on cities, towns, monuments, and historical sites which they could later return to and reference if necessary. This suggests that, while they could be for personal use, they also adopted a more outward and audience-oriented approach to diary writing instead of treating it as a self-reflective exercise. Since travel was considered a learning opportunity, especially for upper-class men, it was common for such men to keep diaries while traveling to document their experiences. The manuscript book copy of John Ward’s travel diary presents an example of this type of writing. As a copy of the original, it calls into question for whom and what this travel diary was intended.",Belgium; Netherlands; France; travel; Holland,"London, England",,,,,,,,compound_object,,public domain,

As a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Society of the Antiquaries, Ward would have been aware of the importance and social use of travel diaries, so it can be assumed that this copy was created to be shared by Ward with his close friends within these societies. Provenance notes allow us to trace former ownership of the diary to Gresham College in London, where Ward was a professor of rhetoric, and eventually to the British Museum/Library, although the precise timeline is unknown. In the diary there is a note in pencil stating that the handwriting found within is not Ward’s, which can lead us to assume that Ward employed a scribe to create this copy. The dated daily entries are reflective of modern diaries, however the straightforward manner in which Ward recounts his days and provides details, historical facts, and context for the sites he visits suggest that this journal could have been both for referential use and an audience of Ward’s upper-class male peers.

Similarly, the author provides the reader with an extremely detailed account of the towns and historical sites they encounter throughout their travels, including an illustration of a bridge layout. Aside from the travel details such as lodging and travel prices, the author provides several pages of generalized practical advice for other travelers. These details, in addition to a preface in which the author states that the diary was written for their friends, demonstrate the practical and social uses of travel diaries in this period.

lwh_200,,Material Crossroads: Adding Life to Print in the Eighteenth Century,Mollie Bowman,2024,"Life writing can encompass the material states of a used and altered text. These include the lingering signs of life in physical alterations of books made by human agents. Take for example a Frankenstein-like Bible, or, a Bible made up of disparate parts pieced together by its owner, James Merrick (1720–1769), an English poet, scholar, and fellow of Trinity College. By disassembling a printed vernacular Bible and inserting its individual pages between manuscript leaves, Merrick placed his dismantled and rehoused Bible at a ‘material crossroads’ between manuscript and print that centralizes human interaction with a text in its altered material state. In other books of the eighteenth century, the intimate relationship between text, material, and person demonstrates how a physical book can show traces of its own life and the lives of those who altered it.

Christian readers were encouraged and taught to annotate their Bibles, whether through instructions printed in prefatory material or devotional guides. It is, then, not surprising that James Merrick, eighteenth-century poet and religious scholar, so extensively annotated his own Bible. However, what is most striking about this object is not necessarily Merrick’s detailed annotations but the unusual measures he took to make those annotations possible, leading to a text that appears materially strange. In an effort to provide himself with the space he needed to take notes on the scriptures, Merrick disassembled a printed vernacular Bible and tipped in, or pasted, its individual pages between a blank manuscript book’s leaves. In doing so, Merrick merged what were the two main vessels of writing: the printed and the manuscript pages. His interaction with the text is not just intellectual, as manifested in his handwritten annotations, but also physical, as readily apparent through this text’s altered material state.

Deodatus Bye (1744–1826), a printer primarily of religious tracts, provided extensive manuscript annotations alongside the printed text, once again merging materials and fostering space for personal interaction with the text. However, unlike Merrick, Bye opted to add manuscript leaves into his Bible rather than adding individual pages to a bound manuscript. Bye’s method of “interleaving” entailed inserting blank pages between printed pages, a process typically done by the printer. It is on these interleaved pages that Bye wrote his substantial notes on the scriptures. Yet, even within this format, Bye adds his own flair. On the tipped in page facing Chapter XLIX of Genesis, Bye has attached a loose manuscript sheet by pinning it to the page with a nail.

The added materials were often in conversation with the text on the facing page. Here, a “head,” or portrait, of Shakespeare has been added, responding to Wilks’s discussion of the bard.

lwh_300,,Formatting Experience: Graphic Literacy in an Eighteenth-Century Manuscript Journal,Genevieve Gordon,2024,"Eighteenth-century manuscript culture emphasized the connection between a developing writer’s fluency with the physical and graphic elements of writing—their graphic literacy—and their moral character and identity. This lends an additional sense of “life” to manuscript life writing activities, where personal content combines with material processes like handwriting and formatting to create a layered process of self-fashioning. Such a process is exemplified in a manuscript travel diary written by a 15-year-old boy named T.W.R., who transformed a blank notebook into a 112-page, 5-chapter description of his travels abroad in 1799. Examining the graphic elements of this journal alongside two print texts that showcase scribal materiality’s relationship to self-fashioning—a copybook for young writers and a printed, ruled, and filled out annual student diary—helps elucidate the varied forms of graphic guidance available to young writers in late eighteenth-century England. In the broader history of life writing, these texts help give a fuller account of the ways young people engaged with the materiality and visuality of composing their own experiences in writing.

One such example is this well-preserved manuscript diary A Journal in Germany, written by a 15-year-old boy from Norwich identified as T.W.R. Written in neat roundhand, T.W.R.’s journal appears to mimic the formatting and paratextual elements of print books, including an index of contents, catchwords, page numbers, and chapter title pages. While the journal may have been copied by a paid professional scribe, the manuscript’s imperfections and inconsistencies suggest the possibility that the diarist himself copied it out from an earlier, rougher version. T.W.R.’s manuscript not only attests to his graphic literacy, but also invites us to speculate about the role of material imitation and emulation in the development of one’s identity through life writing, particularly in adolescence.

One of the notable features of this copy of Benezet’s text is its marbled paper covered boards. Marbling, a decorative technique, added elegance and sophistication to books during the eighteenth century. Its quarter binding, a cheaper alternative to full leather binding, the cover reveals the time period's aesthetic tastes in book design. The eighteenth century saw the peak of the transatlantic slave trade, suggesting Benezet meant for his text to prompt further consideration of the institution of slavery, although the abolishment of slavery would not happen until the nineteenth century.",slave trade; Africa; enslaved persons; religious life; antislavery movements,"London, England",51.507351,-0.127758,https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/14040322,HT1321.B4 1768,folio; printed illustration; marbled cover; paratext,,print,image/jpeg,English,public domain,lwh_700
lwh_703,lwh_703.jpg,Algiers: Being a Complete Picture of the Barbary States,G.A. Jackson,1817,"G.A. Jackson’s account assesses the country of Algiers in a cohesive fashion detailing the country’s government, laws, religion, and production. It also focuses on the country’s relationship to European states, specifically focusing on the various attacks European states imposed on Algiers. The foldout frontispiece features a printed illustration of a map displaying the Barbary states and their relationship to one another. This feature is essential as it puts in visual and spatial perspective the proximity of these states to one another while including the Atlantic Ocean, which separates North Africa from Europe. The account also features 9 hand-colored plates, powerful in their detail of the customs and particular style, of the North Africans. Jackson’s account sits over 350 pages but organized in clear sections, provides a clear understanding of the Barbary states essential to an understanding of the transatlantic slave trade in the eighteenth century while also providing contextual information, such as Algerian participation in piracy and European (Christian) slavery.

The centerpiece, a memoir written by Teresia Constantia Phillips, is a provocative book with a fascinating history. The popularity of her memoir would make Phillips infamous in her time, and it inspired many courtesans and sex workers to write and publish their own memoirs, including the two accompanying pieces. The three selected books explore the lives of women, as written or told by themselves, and represent a group often pushed into the margins of society. Their memoirs showcase how these marginalized women experienced their bodies and sexualities and used the medium of writing to articulate their stories on their own terms.",memoir; history of sex work; courtesans in history; women writers,"London, England; Clerkenwell, England",,,,,,,,compound_object,,public domain,
lwh_801,lwh_801.jpeg,The Promised Justification in Number IV. Volume II. of the Apology,"Phillips, Teresia Constantia",1749,"The Promised Justification in number IV. volume II. of the Apology, was written in 1749 by Teresia Constantia Phillips, to justify her (as regarded at the time) scandalous relationships with various men. The book was written during a precarious time in Phillips’ life, which saw her in a years-long public legal battle with her husband. The memoir was published with the intention of generating controversy and becoming a source of income and independence for Phillips, who was plagued by debt for much of her life. Phillips experienced difficulties in finding publishers and booksellers willing to distribute her book, so she paid to have the books printed in separate volumes, hoping that each new volume would create more controversy and sell more copies than the last. She elected to sell the book from her own home, and all copies were autographed by her to discourage pirating. This somewhat unorthodox method of distribution added several more layers of intimacy and personal connection to the reading experience for her audience.",memoir; history of sex work; courtesans in history; women writers,"London, England",51.507351,-0.127758,https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/37402674,CT788.P55A3 1749.,,,print,image/jpeg,,public domain,lwh_800
lwh_802,lwh_802.jpeg,The Memoirs of Mrs. Sophia Baddeley: late of Drury Lane Theatre,"Steele, Elizabeth",1787,"The Memoirs of Mrs. Sophia Baddeley tells the story of Sophia Baddley (1745 – 1786), a prominent figure and courtesan in 18th-century British society. Baddeley, a prominent actress, was famous for both her beauty and her vanity. Like Teresia Phillips, her excessively extravagant lifestyle led her to debt, and she resorted to acting as a courtesan to several wealthy, influential men to make ends meet. This book is part of a three-volume series and was written by her companion, Elizabeth Steele (1740 – 1787). Steele’s creative take on life writing satirically sentimentalizes Baddeley’s life, parodying the sentimental novels that were growing in popularity in the late 18th century. In addition to the various men discussed in the memoir, the relationship between Baddeley and Steele, while slightly ambiguous, suggests a lesbian relationship between the two, making this memoir an important artifact for the study of queer literature and history.",memoir; history of sex work; courtesans in history; women writers,"Clerkenwell, England",51.527289477781295,-0.10549456674190738,https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/39329359,PN2598.B2S8 1787 v.1/2; PN2598.B2S8 1787 v.3/4; PN2598.B2S8 1787 v.5/6,leather covers; half binding,,print,image/jpeg,,public domain,lwh_800

Her memoir is known for its incredible attention to detail in recreating conversations that she witnessed in her salon. Wilson’s memoir is an important literary artifact because of the “importance” of the men discussed and the clever observations that Wilson makes about her clientele and situation. Wilson’s memoir is notable in the study of life writing not only because of her stylistic choices, but also because of the various copywrite and civil obscenity lawsuits that Wilson faced after it was published. Like Phillips, Wilson originally published her memoir in installments, hoping to capitalize on her connections and notoriety. Unlike Phillips and Steele’s books, however, Wilson’s volumes have been successfully assembled into one compilation, with important scenes illustrated with engravings.",memoir; history of sex work; courtesans in history; women writers,"London, England",51.507351,-0.127758,https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/32182997,DA536.W7A3 1839,,,print,image/jpeg,,public domain,lwh_800
