## About the Collection

Julie Park
Lives Written by Hand, A Digital Exhibition
Spring 2024

In Spring Semester 2024, Julie Park, Paterno Family Librarian for Literature and Professor of English, taught an English Department graduate seminar, “English 597.001: Writing Lives by Hand,” on the materiality of life writing in eighteenth-century England. Alongside more traditional examples of life writing, such as memoir, autobiography, epistolary correspondence and diary writing, this seminar considered life writing as a material practice of recording and documenting the experience of living. Students engaged directly with commonplace books, almanacs, miscellanies, and annotated or extra-illustrated books held in Penn State University’s Eberly Family Special Collections Library to uncover how life writing is deeply entangled with the bibliographic materials, tools and techniques used for producing it. 

In doing so, the seminar developed perspectives on the material nuances inhering in classic experimentations in fictional life writing. From the intricate construction of letters in Samuel Richardson’s _Pamela_ to the subversiveness of the marbled page in Laurence Sterne’s _Tristram Shandy_, these novels’ critical positioning of material texts in their plots and narratives would be unknowable without our encounters with the corresponding bibliographic artifacts held in the Penn State University Library’s Special Collections, as well as the processes of making them.

To that end, a vital feature of the class was the program of workshops Professor Park developed in order to give students an opportunity to experience directly the textual materiality of eighteenth-century life writing. In a letter folding workshop, for instance, held in conjunction with our week on _Pamela_, students learned how to fold letters so they turned into their own envelopes, early modern style, from watching [“letterlocking” videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Letterlocking) produced by the [Unlocking History](https://letterlocking.org/about) team.

The seminar was fortunate to experience workshops led by live experts as well, and is indebted to the expertise of [Marissa Nicosia](https://www.abington.psu.edu/marissa-nicosia), Associate Professor of Renaissance English at Penn State Abington, for leading a workshop on early modern penmanship. With her, the seminar practiced reading early modern handwriting and copied a seventeenth-century manuscript recipe with their own quill pens and iron gall ink.
